# N-dle Solver

A solver designed to beat New York Time's Wordle (link [here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)). If you are bored enough, can extend to solve the more general N-dle problem (for quordle, octordle, etc.)

I originally made this out of frustration for the game (and my own lack of lingual talent). One day, my friend thought she could beat my bot. To her dismay, she learned that she is no better than a machine. Let's see if you can do any better (the average number of attempts is 3.6).

## Usage:
1. Run `python main.py --n 1`
2. Follow the prompts

Currently only supports solving for 1 word at a time (i.e. wordle).
